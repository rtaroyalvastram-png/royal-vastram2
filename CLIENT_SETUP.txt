## Troubleshooting
- **"Python not found"**: You likely forgot to check "Add to PATH" during installation. Re-install Python and check that box.
- **"git is not recognized"**: You need to install Git from the link above.
- **Updates failed**: Check your internet connection. The app will still open with the version you have.
